Eris is a Man-in-the-Middle Proxy Server for the game Realm of the Mad God

## Credits
A lot of information and code examples have been taken without explicit permission from [K-Relay](https://github.com/TheKronks/KRelay/). Because I don't know how K-Relay innards work and I wanted to create my own proxy project.
